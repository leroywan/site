This project started out as an MVP and through multiple rounds of iteration resulted in a conversion rate of 8.6% and over 2000 orders during the Christmas season. </p>\n<h2>Design</h2>\n<p>Santa’s Postal Service is a seasonal store, so naturally, the branding of the company will be jolly and festive, with lots of illustrations that match the theme of Christmas.

This online store was made possible using various automation software that I had developed to generate digital files of the letter once an order has been placed in the storefront.","colors":["#fff2f2","#fffef8","#a11d2d"],"images":["https://leroywan.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/santa__screen.png","https://leroywan.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/santa__screen.png"]}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/canam-systems/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Canam Systems"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/dummy/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"IFI (Under construction)"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a63b5e4c-b942-5664-9387-bbf434c6feec","previousPostId":"f3a224e0-68fa-5b55-b665-cc8978f21068","nextPostId":"0861c153-846e-56a0-8b31-bbcd5352efbf"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
