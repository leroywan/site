overview: "During the winter of 2018, I designed and developed Santa’s Postal Service, an online store that sells fully customizable Christmas letters written, stamped, and wax-sealed by Santa Claus. This project is currently on its third iteration and over 2500 happy children have received their own personal letters from the North Pole. This online store was made possible using various automation software that I had developed to generate digital files of the letter once an order has been placed in the storefront."

# The story
Santa's Postal Service is a seasonal store that sends beautifully crafted, authentic, Christmas letters from Santa Claus to children all over North America. This project started out as an MVP and through multiple rounds of iteration resulted in a conversion rate of 8.6% and over 2000 orders during the Christmas season. 

## Design
Santa’s Postal Service is a seasonal store, so naturally, the branding of the company will be jolly and festive, with lots of illustrations that match the theme of Christmas. The main focus of the store was authenticity ⁠— that we are actually Santa Claus from the North Pole, not the one sitting around in shopping malls. The idea of authenticity is critical. To create the feeling of realness, I manufactured the letterhead & envelope using a linen paper stock, foil-stamped with silver & gold, and wax-sealed using Santa’s signature S. 

## Failed attempt #1 — Too complicated
The first version of Santa’s Postal Service was a failure. I assumed that customers wanted to customize their own Christmas letters — which cannot be further from the truth. People want a customized letter, but they do not want to spend the time to fully customize their own. In fact, only a 5% of customers chose to customize their own letters. Designing an experience around customizability resulted in unnecessary confusion and many Facebook comments about how difficult it was to create a letter. 

## Attempt #2 — A Home Run!
After learning that people were confused about creating their Christmas Letters, I decided to develop an interface that focused on template selection instead of customizability. By prioritizing template selection, I came up with an elegant design that customers wanted to use and understood. 

And nothing makes me happier than seeing happy customers posting about your product (:
