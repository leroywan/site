overview: "During the winter of 2018, I designed and developed Santaâ€™s Postal Service, an online store that sells fully customizable Christmas letters written, stamped, and wax-sealed by Santa Claus. This project is currently on its third iteration and over 2500 happy children have received their own personal letters from the North Pole. This online store was made possible using various automation software that I had developed to generate digital files of the letter once an order has been placed in the storefront."

Did you know that "despite its name, salted duck eggs can also be made from
chicken eggs, though the taste and texture will be somewhat different, and the
egg yolk will be less rich."?
([Wikipedia Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg))

Yeah, I didn't either.
