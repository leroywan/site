overview: "Coachella is a notorious cacophony of performances, selfies, installations, and general madness — and yet we went on location to get people’s attention. In anticipation of Childish Gambino’s new adidas shoe line and forthcoming performance, we sent invites to be the first to wear the shoes via AirDrop. What happened next, no one saw coming."

<!-- Wow! I love blogging so much already.

Did you know that "despite its name, salted duck eggs can also be made from
chicken eggs, though the taste and texture will be somewhat different, and the
egg yolk will be less rich."?
([Wikipedia Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg))

Yeah, I didn't either. -->
