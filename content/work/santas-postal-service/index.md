overview: "During the winter of 2018, I designed and developed Santa’s Postal Service, an online store that sells fully customizable Christmas letters written, stamped, and wax-sealed by Santa Claus. This project is currently on its third iteration and over 2500 happy children have received their own personal letters from the North Pole. This online store was made possible using various automation software that I had developed to generate digital files of the letter once an order has been placed through the storefront."

# The story
Santa's Postal Service is a seasonal store that sends beautifully crafted, authentic, Christmas letters from Santa Claus to children all over North America. This project started out as an MVP and through multiple rounds of iteration resulted in a conversion rate of 8.6% and over 2000 orders during the Christmas season. To match the the high volume of orders as a one-man-show, I developed a piece of software that queries orders from my online store to automate artwork generation which then later gets printed and sent out.

## Design
Santa’s Postal Service is a seasonal store, so naturally, the branding of the company will be jolly and festive with illustrations that match the theme of Christmas. The main focus of this store is authenticity, and to create that feeling of realness, I manufactured the letterhead & envelope using a linen paper stock, foil-stamped with silver & gold, and wax-sealed using Santa’s signature S. This turned out to be critical in our success as customers raved about the quality and attention to detail of these letters.

## Launch attempt #1 — Too complicated
The first version of Santa’s Postal Service was a failure. I assumed that customers wanted to customize their own Christmas letters — which cannot be further from the truth. People want a customized letter, but they do not want to spend the time to fully customize their own. In fact, only a 5% of customers chose to customize their own letters. Designing an experience around customizability resulted in unnecessary confusion and many Facebook comments about how difficult it was to create a letter.

## Launch attempt #2 — A Home Run!
After learning about why people were confused about creating their own letters, I decided to A/B test a new interface that focused on template selection instead of customizability. By prioritizing template selection, I came up with an elegant design that customers wanted to use and understood.

And nothing makes me happier than seeing happy customers post about your product on your Facebook page (:

## Follow up — Volume
As a one-man-band, fulfilling thousands of orders in the span of a few weeks would be impossible without any sort of automation. Since I am a developer at heart, I built a piece of software that takes the orders from my online store to produce digital files that I can easily print out. I also built this tool to enable me (and future employees) to manually edit each order in case of spelling and spacing issues.
