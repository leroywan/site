## Ekipo.io
Ekipo.io is a Slack app that helps remote companies build a better work culture through recognition and gamification. After creating 3 different landing pages and interviewing various founders of remote companies (~16 employees), I created a prototype that I tested with an agency for 2 weeks — I decided not to continue with this project after discovering that Ekipo.io is not well-suited for most remote companies.

## Stereogram Generator
I was watching a [Youtube video about Stereograms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8O8Em_RPNg) one day and was inspired to create a stereogram generator after learning the concept behind creating the illusion. I took this as an opportunity to learn Vue.js. [View project](https://leroywan.github.io/stereogram-message-generator/)
